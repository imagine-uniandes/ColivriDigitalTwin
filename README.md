# ColivriDigitalTwin

## About the Project

ColivriDigitalTwin is a Unity-based project that aims to create a digital replica of the Colivri laboratory at the University of Los Andes. The project facilitates experimentation and the development of new technologies, emphasizing virtual and augmented reality, simulators, and human-robot interfaces. This initiative is led by a team of students as part of their degree project within the Systems Engineering program at the university.

### Organization of Objects and Naming Conventions in Unity

In this project, the organization of objects should be structured hierarchically for easy navigation and maintenance. We utilize the UpperCamelCase convention, which applies to all objects, classes, and structures within Unity. Please adhere to this convention when contributing to the project.

#### Naming Scheme: UpperCamelCase

The UpperCamelCase convention implies that the first letter of each word is capitalized without spaces.

#### Example

### Object Organization

Objects within Unity are organized in a clear hierarchical structure. In the example provided above, `FirstFloor` is a prefab, and `Floor`, `Column1`, `Walls` are child objects.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Creating a precise virtual replica of the Colivri Laboratory in Unity.
2. Detailed representation of equipment, devices, and spaces within the laboratory.
3. Developing realistic and functional interactions with the television screens, allowing users to interact with them as a control center for the digital twin.
4. Exploring and optimizing the use of various virtual, augmented, and digital reality platforms for experiencing the Digital Twin.
5. Critically evaluating the effectiveness and utility of virtual television screens as essential components of the Digital Twin, particularly in terms of learning and simulation for students, professionals, and users of the Colivri Laboratory in the realm of virtual and augmented reality.

## Functionality

The ColivriDigitalTwin project offers the following key functionalities:

### Quick control of the laboratory

From a large format control panel, users can have a quick overview of all activities happening in the laboratory. This functionality enables:

- Intuitive control.
- Safety visualization.
- Functional simulation (audio).

### Show future configurations

The project also facilitates the display of future configurations, particularly on the screens, allowing:

- Intuitive control.
- Viewing from various platforms.

### AR - Adding information to the real world

In the context of Augmented Reality, the project enables users to view additional information about the equipment in the laboratory, including:

- Historical and real-time information viewing.
- Identification of points with critical information.
- Intuitive control.

## Getting Started
