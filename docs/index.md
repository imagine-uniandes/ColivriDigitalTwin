Leveraging the potential of various mixed reality platforms

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity. By bridging the physical and the virtual world, data is transmitted seamlessly allowing the virtual entity to exist simultaneously with the physical entity.

## What is Colivri?

Colivri (Collaboratory on Interaction, Visualization, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems) is a collaboration space among various departments of the University, for the development of computational experiences with innovative interfaces. Virtual and Augmented Reality, simulators, and human-robot interfaces are some of the technologies we use for the development of new solutions to local and international problems.

## **Objectives**

Colivri Digital Twin is created with several objectives in mind:

- **Experiment on GD:** Create useful functionality for laboratories at Uniandes.
- **Group work support:** With the support of the Dept., generate an infrastructure for the development of group degree projects.
- **Timeline of work:** Create an open platform that can be extensible over time.
